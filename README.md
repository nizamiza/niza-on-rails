This is the source code for the [niza.cz](https://niza.cz) website written in
Ruby on Rails.

I usually go full vanilla when it comes to building my personal website, but
this time I wanted to try something new. Using products by [37signals](https://37signals.com)
and listening to their podcasts, I got inspired to try Ruby on Rails. Will see
how it goes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
