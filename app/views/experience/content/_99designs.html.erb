    I always had passion towards graphic design and art in general. When I was
    15 years old, I started to learn design tools and attempted my first design
    contents on various freelance platforms. At first, it didn't go that well as
    my work wasn't of high quality. But with time and practice, I grew
    professionally and started to earn some money. My biggest success was
    winning several contents on 99designs.

    Experience in graphic design helped me to understand the importance of
    visual communication and user experience. It also helped me to develop a
    good eye for detail and aesthetics. To this day, I use these skills in my
    work.
