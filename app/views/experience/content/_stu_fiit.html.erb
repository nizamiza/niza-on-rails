    STU FIIT - Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Faculty of
    Informatics and Information Technologies was my first experience of studying
    abroad. I learned a lot about computer science, software engineering, and
    web development. I didn't finish my studies there, but it was a great
    experience that helped me to grow professionally and personally.

    FIIT, especially in the first years, felt like Hogwarts but for Computer
    Science. The atmosphere and teachers were incredible.
