    My greatest professional experience so far has been leading UNIIT's
    technology and HR departments. At this hybrid position, I learned a lot
    about leadership, management, and business. I was responsible for the
    following:

    * Setting up and maintaining the company's IT infrastructure
    * Developing and implementing IT policies and best practices
    * Designing and conducting technical interviews
    * Designing and conducting performance evaluations

    I continued to work as a full stack web developer and was involved in the
    development of various projects. I conducted code reviews and mentored
    junior developers.

    As I was promoted to the CTO position, I had to learn more about
    infrastructure, security, monitoring, and DevOps. Specifically,
    I learned about:

    * [Space Automation Jobs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/automation.html)
    * AWS & GCP
    * Docker & Kubernetes
    * Sentry
    * BugSnag

    Thanks to this experience, I learned about the importance of communication
    and teamwork.
