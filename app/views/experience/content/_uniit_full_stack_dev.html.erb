    UNIIT was my first-ever full-time job and it was the best kind of first job
    I could have asked for. I was given a lot of freedom and trust to work on
    various projects. As a full stack web developer, I participated in the
    development of web applications using technologies such as:

    * JavaScript (ES6+)
    * TypeScript
    * React
    * Node.js
    * Express
    * PostgreSQL
    * Prisma ORM
    * GraphQL
    * Nexus
    * Deno
    * Fresh
    * PocketBase
    * etc.

    As part of my daily agenda, I also conducted code reviews and mentored
    junior developers.
